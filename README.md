# Hybrid TestNG Framework

This project is a hybrid TestNG framework designed for automated testing of web applications. It includes the Page Object Model (POM) and Page Factory design patterns to enhance code readability and maintainability.

## Features

- **Page Object Model (POM)**: Organizes web elements and actions for each page.
- **Page Factory**: Utilizes the Page Factory design pattern for improved object initialization.
- **Automated Test Cases**: Covers Login, Register, and Search functionalities.
- **WebDriverManager**: Manages WebDriver binaries automatically.

## Description

The Hybrid TestNG Framework project is designed to streamline the automation testing process for web applications. It leverages the strengths of the Page Object Model (POM) and Page Factory design patterns to ensure that the tests are easy to maintain and extend.

### Key Features

1. **Page Object Model (POM):**
   - **Separation of Concerns:** By separating the UI elements and the test scripts, POM ensures that changes to the UI do not affect the test scripts directly. This makes the framework more maintainable.
   - **Code Reusability:** Common actions and elements are abstracted into reusable methods, reducing code duplication.

2. **Page Factory Design Pattern:**
   - **Efficient Element Initialization:** Page Factory provides a more efficient way of initializing web elements with the `@FindBy` annotation. This results in more readable and concise code.
   - **Improved Performance:** Lazy initialization of elements improves performance, as elements are only initialized when they are used.

3. **Automated Test Cases:**
   - The framework includes pre-built automated test cases for crucial functionalities such as Login, Register, and Search. These serve as examples and starting points for further test case development.

4. **WebDriverManager Integration:**
   - **Simplified WebDriver Management:** WebDriverManager automatically handles the setup and management of WebDriver binaries, ensuring compatibility with the latest browser versions without manual intervention.
   - **Cross-Browser Testing:** Easily switch between different browsers for testing without worrying about binary compatibility issues.

### Benefits

- **Ease of Maintenance:** With the POM and Page Factory patterns, maintaining and updating the tests becomes simpler, even as the application evolves.
- **Scalability:** The modular structure of the framework allows for easy addition of new test cases and functionalities.
- **Efficiency:** Automated WebDriver management and reusable page components enhance the efficiency of the testing process.

### Getting Started

To start using this framework, clone the repository, install the dependencies using Maven, and run the tests using TestNG. Detailed instructions are provided in the Setup section.

### Future Enhancements

- **Integration with CI/CD:** Plan to integrate the framework with continuous integration and continuous deployment tools like Jenkins or GitHub Actions for automated test execution.
- **Reporting:** Implement advanced reporting tools like Allure or ExtentReports for detailed test execution reports.
- **Enhanced Test Coverage:** Gradually expand the test cases to cover more functionalities and edge cases.

This Hybrid TestNG Framework project aims to provide a robust and flexible foundation for web application testing, ensuring high-quality software delivery through reliable and efficient automated tests.
